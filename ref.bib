abstract = {A statistical evaluation on the upper mesospheric and lower thermospheric temperature effects caused by energetic particle precipitation is performed on the basis of data from the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) and NOAA 15, 16, and 17 satellites. By combining particle measurement from the medium energy proton and electron detectors (MEPED) on board the NOAA satellites, maps of the global particle precipitation can be obtained close in time to the SABER (Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry) temperature retrieval. Using large data sets, sorted by season, local time, and geomagnetic latitude, we investigated whether there are significant temperature effects in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere associated with the energetic particle precipitation. During both May/June and October/November 2003, we found a temperature increase related to particle precipitation at all heights above 100 km. In general, we did not find a consistent immediate temperature modification below 100 km associated with increased particle flux. Considering the temperatures retrieved during the extraordinary large geomagnetic storms in late October 2003, we found a cooling effect associated with energetic particle precipitation.},

@article{NewellP.T.2004Mopb,
abstract = {We present maps of ionospheric precipitation regions, based on 11 years of DMSP particle data, binned by the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), with superposed SuperDARN convection streamlines gathered under similar conditions. The convection patterns are transformed into an inertial coordinate system. The maps, which include both the nightside and dayside, are created in a fully automated fashion, with, for example, the cusp centered at its centroid latitude for each half hour bin of MLT, with a latitudinal width equal to the statistical difference between the poleward and equatorward edges. The mantle asymmetry about noon does not fit the pattern expected from simple theoretical considerations (namely, that the mantle should be thicker postnoon for positive in the Northern Hemisphere). The mantle is appreciably thicker prenoon than postnoon, especially for positive but also even for negative. This asymmetry matches the SuperDARN convection flows, in which, irrespective of the sign of, most of the conversion of closed field lines to open occurs prenoon. Quantitatively expressed, for southward IMF, the potential encompassed by flux crossing the open-closed boundary prenoon (0600-1200 MLT) exceeds that for postnoon (1200-1800 MLT) by 30 kV to 15 kV for > 3 nT and by 30 kV to 20 kV for 3 nT, 31 kV reconnects from 1800 to 2400 MLT, but only 14 kV reconnects from 0000 to 06000 MLT. The convection reversal boundary (CRB) consistently coincides with the nightside open-closed particle boundary (OCB). On the dayside, the CRB lies equatorward (poleward) of the OCB in the postnoon (prenoon) sector for 0). This shift is consistent with the effects of an interhemispheric current produced by the partial penetration of the IMF into the frontside magnetosphere.},
